# Parallel Tempering (Replica Exchange)
#
# Parallel tempering runs multiple replicas at different temperatures
# and periodically attempts to exchange configurations between replicas.
#
# TODO: Implement parallel tempering algorithm
# - Multiple replicas at different β values
# - Exchange moves between neighboring temperatures
# - Acceptance based on energy difference and temperature difference

# Placeholder for future implementation
