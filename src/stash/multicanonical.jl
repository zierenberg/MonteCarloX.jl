# Multicanonical (Generalized Ensemble) Methods
#
# Multicanonical sampling allows efficient sampling across energy barriers
# by using a modified weight function based on density of states.
#
# TODO: Implement multicanonical algorithm
# - Weight function: w(E) = 1/g(E) where g(E) is density of states
# - Iterative refinement of g(E) through Wang-Landau or similar
# - Flat histogram in energy space

# Placeholder for future implementation
