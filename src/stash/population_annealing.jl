# Population Annealing
#
# Population annealing maintains a population of replicas and periodically
# resamples based on Boltzmann weights as temperature is lowered.
#
# TODO: Implement population annealing algorithm
# - Population of independent replicas
# - Resampling step based on relative weights
# - Annealing schedule (temperature progression)
# - Family tree tracking for analysis

# Placeholder for future implementation
